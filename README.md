## Development setup

This repo contains two projects: the web api written using ASP.NET (`QuizAppApi`) and react frontend using Vite (`better-frontend`).
You first need to run web api and, after that, run the frontend.

### DB setup

We use mssql server dbms. Make sure to install it, a viable option is to use [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server).
No matter how you setup your dbms, you need to get the connection string, it may look like this:
```
Server=127.0.0.1,1433; Database=Master; User Id=SA; Password=REALLY_SECURE_PASSWORD; Encrypt=False; TrustServerCertificate=True;
```
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmV_IBYIlyo&list=PL82C6-O4XrHdiS10BLh23x71ve9mQCln0&index=5) may help when setting up the db.

Connection string is added via secret:
```bash
cd QuizAppApi/QuizAppApi
dotnet user-secrets init
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionString" "YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING"
```

Make sure to [apply migrations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/applying?tabs=dotnet-core-cli) (You can google on how to do that)

### Backend setup

If you are using an ide, setup should be straightforward. You can also run it via cli:

``` bash
dotnet run # or
dotnet watch
```

### Backend tests

To run .NET tests use this command in QuizAppApi.sln directory:

``` bash
dotnet test
```

### Frontend setup

```bash
cd better-frontend/
npm install
npm run dev
```

### OpenAI API setup

1) Create ```.openai``` file in ```QuizAppApi/QuizAppApi``` directory
2) Edit ```.openai``` file to look like this: ```OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'```

## Branching strategy

### Branches

- **Main branch** - used as a branch for all feature branches to merge and in this environment the app is tested.
- **Feat branch** - these branches are branched from _main branch_ and are used for developing.
  - Each feature branch is used for a different task and each feature branch belongs to it's owner and should be worked on by the owner.

## Naming

### Branch naming

- Branch names should begin with _feat_
- Feat branch name should give information about the task
- Words in branch name are seperated by dashes (-)
- If the feat branch is a branch of another feat branch, the name should have a number at the end

#### Example

- "feat-pipeline"
- "feat-pipeline-2"

### Commit naming

Commit messages should begin with one of the following:

- Add
- Delete
- Change
- Fix

#### Example

- "Add ASP.NET template"
- "Change README.md"
- "Delete build files"
