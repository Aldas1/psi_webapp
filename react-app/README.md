# React frontend

## Setup

Make sure you have Node.js installed. It is advised to use VSCode for frontend.
Note: you must be in `react-app` directory to run the frontend.

Install packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Run frontend:

```bash
npm run dev # You can press 'o' in cli window and it will open url in browser
```

## Project structure and routing

We use React Router for routing. You should create route component in `/src/routes` directory and properly setup routing in `/src/main.jsx` (see the file for examples)
